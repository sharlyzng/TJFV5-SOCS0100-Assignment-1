# TJFV5-SOCS0100-Assignment-1
Project title: Covid-19 trends across countries

This project was built in fulfillment of UCL's Computational Social Sciences module assessment.

#Introduction to TJFV5-SOCS0100-Assignment-1
This project draws on data from the covid_full_data.csv that presents case and death rates of 
Covid-19 across all countries. Data inspection, wrangling and visualisation techniques were 
carried out to produce three meaningful data visualisations across three Rscripts. 

#Introduction-to-dataset.R
This Rscript introduces the packages required to replicate the data wrangling and visualisation
carried out in this project. Furthermore, it accomplishes a primary inspection of the 
covid_full_data.csv dataset.

#Covid-19-World.R
This Rscript focuses on producing 2 data visualisation. Firstly, the 

#Covid-19-by-income.R
This Rscript scrutinises the distribution of Covid-19 impacts by income group by observing 
survival rates across income groups.

#Covid-19-Report.qmd
This Quarto document contains my chronological explanation of the data inspection, wrangling and visualisation
processes, and contains snippets of code from the above-mentioned Rscripts.
A reflection on the use of Copilot, Microsoft's Artificial Intelligence tool, is included at the end of the document.
